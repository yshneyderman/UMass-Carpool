Users will be able to create trips with origin, destination, max occupancy, and their respective times as a "party" and other users will be able to search by any of those fields and join the party. 

For instance if I wanted to see if other people want to join me to go to Wendy's, I create a new trip titled "Wendy's" and select max seats as 4 (I can fit 4 more people in my small car). I select that I will leave from orchard hill parking lot 43 at 10pm and arrive at Wendy's at 10:15. Under the note I can also put return trip info and then I would send it out and people on the app would see a new event or upon searching for wendy's they would see the event and be able to join - thus taking up one of my 4 seats. 

The app should also allow users to set notifications for certain keywords like if a user wants to be notified every time a trip to "Wendy's" is created. Additional things to consider would be rewards like icons or achievements for people to use the app in certain ways, ability to create accounts (we'd have to research some security stuff), and a more interesting name.
